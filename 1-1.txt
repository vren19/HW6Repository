1. A terminal is a way to get your computer to do something without using 
GUI. GUI are helpful to visually see where everything is stored 
(folders, subfolders, files) and makes it easier to click to complete tasks, 
but depending on the task you are trying to complete, it may take a 
lot of clicks. The terminal makes it easy to repeat tasks by typing and 
eliminates the need for clicking. 
2. TCP/IP powers the internet. Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf
developed TCP/IP.
3. Client side of the internet is what we see. I type a URL (address)
into the URL bar. This requests that I want to view something specific
that is found at that address. The address is an IP address. Each IP 
address coresponds to a server. A server is a computer that is set up to 
wait for requests and fulfill requests. The requests come from the Client 
through the form of a URL. The server pulls everything associated with 
the IP address and sends them back to the client in response. 
4. We can visit GitHub to leverage modules of existing code.
